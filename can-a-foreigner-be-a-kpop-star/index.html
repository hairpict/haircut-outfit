<p>Being a kpop star is a harsh job. Warning some entertainments companies are really strict. Set up auditions with companies like SM Cube and BigHit and be confident during your performance. Lets please not forget that Kpop is highly influenced and its structured on Hip Hop and RB which is something people with darker skin color have createdThe Kpop basically took foreigners music ideas and created their ownNow Im not saying that thats wrong what Im saying is that non Asians should be accepted because we created this type of music first off. ONLY if you have the talents and looks they are looking for. How To Become A Kpop Idol As A Foreigner Otakukart.</p>
