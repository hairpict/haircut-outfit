<p>Theres no point in dating when Ill already be busy. This is a quiz to determine if you truly have a chance at becoming a K-Pop idol May be offensive to some people. Its not a very common thing for idols who arent from any Asian descent to become a kpop idol but I guess Alex Fatou etc are good examples. And my worst nightmare is no becoming a k pop idol because thats my dream. Unless you are Jeon Somi who has a Korean mother. Pin On D O.</p>

<p>Yes but by non-Koreans they still strictly have to be asian such as Chinese Japanese Thai Taiwanese. Im me always stick to it. Asians might have a bit of an advantage but if youre non-Asian you are still welcomed to take this test. Also you can become a kpop idol if you are non-Asian. You dont learn the language you dont make it. Our Little Baby Maknaes Chapter 29 Names In 2021 Kpop Girl Groups Twice Group Fandom Kpop.</p>

<p>Of course you can. Its not that bad. Unless you are Jeon Somi who has a Korean mother. If you want to be an idol in Korea you have to have good Korean. His father is German and his mother is Korean. Pin On Kpop.</p>
