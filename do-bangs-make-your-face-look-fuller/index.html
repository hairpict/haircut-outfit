<p>I find that bangs that end near cheekbone level can be slimming but it depends on your face shape. Key to Choosing Haircuts by Hair Type Thin hair can be stick-straight slightly wavy or even kinky and you need to factor the texture in. Last of all I think the graphic nature of the cut is a great way to counter the softness of a round shape. Note the slight choppiness on the ends which breaks them up a bit and adds softness. Instead of straight bangs go for thick side-swept bangs that are cut at a strong angle. Inspirierende Dicke Lange Frisuren Frisur Thick Hair Styles Oblong Face Hairstyles Short Hair With Bangs.</p>

<p>With the proper hairstyle you can really hide wide cheekbones or chubby cheeks as well as make the massive chin better-looking. Sweep your bangs to the side and use a comb to tease just the roots of your strands to give them a touch of volume. Side swept bangs are an excellent choice for round faces as they reduce the fullness of the face. The key is to not cut your bangs in a straight line but more rounded. As you can see a full horizontal fringe really helps to widen her face. Also Yes Really Like The Thicker Fuller Look I Like Your Hair Hair Beauty Hair Styles.</p>
