Extremely long-haired cats will require vigorous combing with a firm wire brush three to four times a week in order to keep the fur smooth and free from tangles or mats. In long hair cats the cycle is less frequent and somewhat weather dependent accounting for less constant shedding and more of a shedding season Of course this may vary from cat to cat but from my personal experience I think short hair cats shed more.

<p>I think more important than the amount of shedding is how much time you really want to spend grooming in terms of choosing what hair length to look for in a cat. Extremely long-haired cats will require vigorous combing with a firm wire brush three to four times a week in order to keep the fur smooth and free from tangles or mats. Short hair cats shed more than long haired cats. Since there is more hair on these cats you can expect a greater chance of matted fur and hairballs. Which can lead to a grumpy cat.
