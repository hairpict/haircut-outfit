<p>Every time I do I end up hating it and for me shorter hair makes my face look chubbier and older. Its much simpler for women with short hair to create a few extra centimetres of height. Its actually easier to appear taller if your hair is short. If one happens to be overweight and has long hair it tends to make them look even stockier. Poker-straight hair may be trendy but if you dont have a long slim oval-shaped face the flat iron is your enemy. Pin On Hair.</p>
