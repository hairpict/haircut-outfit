<p>If you are short the recommended hair length to make you look thinner is up to six or seven inches below your shoulders. I think hair looks longer the thinner you are. If you get the medium length bob haircut like in model that you choose in hadviser then you can style your thin hair conveniently. A good tip is making your hair lighter. This will add volume and natural texture. Pin On Hair.</p>

<p>With the proper hairstyle you can really hide wide cheekbones or chubby cheeks as well as make the massive chin better-looking. As you can see long hair can make you look thinner but it also depends on your height and how overweight you are. Giving your hair a wavy or curly affect is another great way to make your face appear thinner. You want to get hidden layers around your hair and avoid short ones around the crown. The longer length try for shoulder length or longer draws the eye down and makes your face appear slimmer. Pin On Belleza.</p>
