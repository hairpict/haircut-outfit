<p>I answer the question of how much on average a kpop idol gets paid. As for idols that come from overseas only see their family once a year which isnt a lot if you compare it to the others. Plus the jacket shooting for the mv you know the concept photos and all would be. Is there any age limit for kpop idols when they get older. I am wondering how much rest a group or idol would usually get. Top Ten Kpop Idols With Thick Lips Attractive Kpop Idols Bae Suzy Suzy Beautiful.</p>

<p>To answer rightly to the question there is a average wage which is different for every group and rather low but each idol gets different pay from their own activities. Most idols train for upwards of two years. No theres no real age limit although groups most commonly disband around 7 years after debut after their first contract expires. In addition to living and training expenses releasing an album costs anywhere from an estimated 215000 to 430000. Artists devote the most glorious years of their career to earn enough income for the remaining years.

<p>So lets say an event brings in 1 million. Of course she has to share her profits with her agency and just part of the profits is hers but its true she earns much more than ordinary people. A typical Kpop Group is 6 membersso they will split 10 amongst themselves. Ofc I dont ask this question for groups like Big Bang SNSD Super Junior or TVXQ. 0033 PST Aug 19 2020.
