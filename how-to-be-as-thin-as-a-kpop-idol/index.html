<p>Its no doubt that kpop idols have a strict workout routine as well as a diet. So to keep it short idols lose weight because of extreme dieting and dancing for 10 hours a day when being a trainee. And thankfully its not that hard to train for some light strength training plenty of cardio and conditioning and dieting to get to low levels of body fat are really all that it takes. But remember that you can never skip meals. But on the bright side you can still get a thinner body but you just wont be as thin as kpop idol because of how bad their health is just by.
