<p>It determines where the shortest layer falls. Use a spray bottle to spray the hair so that its damp but not dripping. Answer 1 of 12.

<p>ESTABLISH THE LENGTH Point cut into the hair sticking out from comb cutting more length from the top half and less from the bottom half. This will give you shorter pieces in the hair towards your face and longer with hair more away. For short layered hair use a rat tail comb.

<p>Cut the Hair Layer by Layer 1. Glide the razor through the front portion of your hair to create a choppy layer. The technique used depends on exactly how you want the finished cut to look but for the most choppy effect you want to perform what is known as point cutting where once the base haircut is completed you go back over the head and hold the hair in segments straight out from the scalp and cut inward from the ends of the hair at an angle to create notches in the hair. Ask your hairdresser for long soft layers and the result will be extra texture and volume. Another useful method is to do this but in several layers.
