<p>The technique used depends on exactly how you want the finished cut to look but for the most choppy effect you want to perform what is known as point cutting where once the base haircut is completed you go back over the head and hold the hair in segments straight out from the scalp and cut inward from the ends of the hair at an angle to create notches in the hair. Cut through it twice with the razor to make the choppy layer more dramatic. If you prefer not to have a chemical service you might consider using large sponge rollers to give the hair some wave. These can be set in the evening and worn while sleeping to let the hair dry overnight. This can be a good choice for women with wavy hair too.
