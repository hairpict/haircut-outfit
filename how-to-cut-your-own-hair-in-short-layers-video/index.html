<p>Theres no question that a mans hair is important part to his overall look. The shag hairstyle is a reinvention of the iconic 90s Rachel haircut. The shorter hairs may start to lift off the head similar to when a cowlick is cut too short and it stands on end like Alfalfa Small explains. Getting a messy hairstyle for short hair isnt that difficult and you can easily do it on your own. Once youve done that you can trim a section at a time by holding the hair between your fingers sliding your fingers down to the desired length and cutting off the remaining hair.
