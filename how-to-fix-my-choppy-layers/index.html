<p>Heyi have recently got layers in my hair but when it dries they go all wavy in a bad way but it is also really flat on the top. Answer 1 of 10. I had Yvette do my waxing. Im 50 and I want to get my nice long hair back. If you do want layers or your stylist wants to add them just be careful not to over-layer. Pin On Haircuts.</p>
