<p>Move on to your inner eye and roll out towards your temples before doing the same for your eye brows. Then roll upwards from your eye brows towards your hairline while moving across your forehead and end the face rolling routine by rolling from the middle of the forehead towards your temples. After youve applied the foundation apply a little highlighter in the centre of your forehead cheeks and chin to give your face a little more volume. If you have an oval face you can choose almost any type of foundation though we recommend using the same tone for the entire face. You can try a glass with angular frame to add some structure.

Like dermal fillers a surgeon will strategically inject Botox into your face to help you achieve your desired results. Converting a long rectagle to an oval shaped face is possible with fillers micro fat transfers and craniofacial techniques for skeletal augmentation or bone reduction surgeries. Use a highlighting powder to highlight the middle of your face such as the center of your forehead and the tip of your chin. For long-shaped face go for Long Flat Brows.
