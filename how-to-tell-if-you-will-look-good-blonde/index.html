<p>As for your eyes. Find out whether your skin is warm or cool toned this will decide which blonde tones work best for you. For the first 23 years of my life the fight was constantly to get my naturally oily hair to look clean. If theyre mostly blue and purple you. If you have light eyes and light or light-to-medium skin blonde hair will work well.

<p>Are you wondering if you should have Blonde Brown Black or Red Hair. If you have a pink tone to your skin and get sunburned before you tan theres a very good chance youll make a fantastic blond. I have an alternative and unconventional viewpoint on beauty the body types and face shapes. Judging by that pick and your description of your eyelashes and brows dark hair would look very fake and not suit you. Your skin tone is fair or pale.

<p>Whether you are going for a subtle sun-kissed look or a head-turning ombre look blonde tones need to be part of your color palette. Blonde is one of the most requested hair colors in salons especially when it comes to highlights. If you go to a salon theyll also probably be able to tell you if brown locks would suit you but honestly. Youd probably suit both or more neutral tones of red. After you bleach your hair everything you once knew about it is basically over.
