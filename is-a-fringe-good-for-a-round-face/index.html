<p>But bangs can still look great with your face shape. Like rectangular frames square glasses add balance and angles to the soft features of a round face. High buns and ponytails are great for adding height but remember to leave some wispy strands hanging down to soften the roundness and elongate the face. Another great fringe for a rounder face is a side swoop which is soft around the edges but long and wider at. However you might have overlooked how essential it is to learn how to part your hair according to your face shape.

<p>Like Chrissy Teigen Emma Stone or Kirsten Dunst the best fringe for you is a side-swept one because it gives your face some angles thereby adding length. If you were to go for a straight-across blunt fringe all this would do is exaggerate the width of your face and make it appear more moon-shaped. This face shape is defined by a rounded jawline and a forehead thats slightly wider than the chin. For these face shapes straight bangs are a big no-no as they accentuate your faces fullness. It has a rounding effect because it covers most of the forehead only a tiny corner is showing above her left eye and then it hits right at brow level before tapering down on one side.

<p>If you have a round face you might already know that you can rock both long locks and short pixie haircuts with ease and flair. Your face shape is the most versatile so experiment with shorties or a longer fringe to match the style you seek. If you were to go for a straight-across blunt fringe all this would do is exaggerate the width of your face and make it appear more moon-shaped. It is common for people with round faces to completely disregard the fringe fearing that it will make the face appear fuller. Your fringe should balance out your face shape by making it appear longer ie. Pin On Hair.</p>
