Easily grabs onto all hair even fine ones. Just as it is possible for hair to be too short to wax it is also possible for hair to be too long.

Waxing can only be done when the hair is between 14- to 12-inch long. The best thing to do is use hair clippers with a guard attachment that will quickly trim it to an even Â¼ long before waxing.

<p>So here is the dilemma. Theres a lot to know about getting waxed. Wait for hair to grow out for 3-6 weeks depending on your hair growth cycle so that your results look better and last for longer. Can grasp thicker hairs but has a harder time taking out fine ones. Shaving can be done as often as necessary but keep in mind that. Pin On Hair.</p>

<p>Shaving can be done as often as necessary but keep in mind that. You get a very smooth surface if its done correctly. If the hair breaks it will cause ingrown hairs and irritation. Wax cant pick up your hairs when theyre too short. Too long and itll break and be difficult to remove. Pin On Fine Hair.</p>
