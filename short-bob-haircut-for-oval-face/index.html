<p>Its quite long for a pixie haircut and really demonstrates how you can continue with simple hairstyles when your pixie is growing out. Just as everyone has a smile every face shape has a haircut which flatters them better than others. For oval-faced ladies who like short hair a blunt bob haircut or lob haircut with subtle layers will look particularly chic. With plenty of layers and tousled finish a shag haircut is great for short to medium hair and while itll look great on thick hair this cut is especially great for those with fine hair which lacks volume and movement. If you prefer long hair on the other hand opt for minimal layers or style your hair with waves or curls to keep it from dragging down your face.
