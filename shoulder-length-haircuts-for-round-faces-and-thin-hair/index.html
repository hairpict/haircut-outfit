The shoulder length hair and dark to light transition help slim your face. If youre looking to hide the narrow look of your face shape a layered bang helps conceal it in a stylish way. The textured shape will visually give definition and structure. One one side cut the hair just a little bit below the ears while on the other part you keep the hair reaching your shoulder level.
