<p>The major parameters in relation to design of cut slopes are the slope angle and height of the cut. Another undesired factor that lead to destabilize slopes in silt is the erosion due water. A slope is an inclined boundary surface between air and the body of an earthwork such as highways cut or fill railway cut or fill earth dams levees and river training work.</p>
<h3 id="as-a-cut-is-made-in-clay-the-effective-stress-is-reduced">As a cut is made in clay the effective stress is reduced.</h3><p>AASHTO recommends that cut slopes steeper than 31 be evaluated with regard to. This Highway Slope Manual is to be cited as GEO 2017. On fill slopes cutting length can vary from 20 to 50 meters. Typically this will result in longer cut slopes and add slight to moderate cuts at the center line. 11 woud mean one foot horizontal for every foot of depth or 100 slope or 45 degree angle. For this reason the factor of safety of a cut slope in clay may decrease with time.</p>
