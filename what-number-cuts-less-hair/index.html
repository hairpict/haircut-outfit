<p>Sometimes the frontal part of the hair is left with a number 6 length of hair while the rest of the hair has lower number hair lengths. You could for example have it transition down to a number 1 or 2 on the clippers to leave some hair around the ears. If youre looking to experiment with a new hair color this is an especially appealing style as theres so much less hair to dye. I really did not want to pay 30-50 for a haircut and I could not get any appointments. Also if you are balding then a number 2 haircut length is ideal for you to keep some of those bushes in tact.
