<p>If so think no more it does not make your hair grow back thicker covering the bald spots or at least grow any faster. I do still have my ponytail and want to donate it just looking for the best place to do somy. The honest truth is that getting rid of hair wont make it come back in thicker or more radiant.</p>
<h3 id="it-is-a-false-theory">It is a false theory.</h3><p>As a matter of fact cutting your hair will not make it grow more radiant and thicker. Cutting hair short will make it look thicker and more voluminous because hairs are naturally thicker closer to the scalp. By trimming unhealthy split ends your hair will have less breakage and flyaways making it look thicker and even shinier. One youve probably heard growing up is that cutting your hair shorter will make it grow longer. Ask your stylist for a cut thats blunt with no texturizing or thinning out Though a pixie is relatively low maintenance when it comes to daily styling you may need to visit the salon more regularly to keep your locks at the right length. Turns out it wont make your hair grow faster knew it.</p>
