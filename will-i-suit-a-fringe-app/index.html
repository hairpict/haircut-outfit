<p>I definitely do NOT suit a fringe so Im very grateful for the app for showing me this. Fringe will look great by. For extra texture shaggy bangs work well with a variety of layered cuts. Would it suit my face shape. From a short fringe to a longer one a side swoop or a block fringe there are many types of fringes and choosing which style to go for can be an extremely daunting and scary process.
